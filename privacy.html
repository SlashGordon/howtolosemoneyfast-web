          <br><br>
          We have activated IP anonymization. This means your IP address will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union 
          or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before being transmitted to the United States. Only in 
          exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and shortened there.

          Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity for website operators, 
          and to provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third 
          parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.

          For this purpose, the browser you use must connect to Google's servers. As a result, Google becomes aware that your IP address was 
          used to access our website. The use of Google Fonts is in the interest of a uniform and appealing presentation of our online offerings.
